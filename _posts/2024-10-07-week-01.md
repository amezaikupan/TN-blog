# Weekly fails:
- Boundary setting: I feel like I'm ready to face the reality that I need to set boundary and that it's healthy. 


# Weekly lessons:
- I'm learning the basics of VIM :> Very fun. I can imagine a future where I can code very fast like Goerge Hotz (... stated very lightly).


# Ideas:
- I want to create a tutorial/post for intro to CI from my 3 weeks learning about CI.
