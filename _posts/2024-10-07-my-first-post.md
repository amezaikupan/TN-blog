# First blog post

Back to writing my blog. This time I'm serious. So serious I gonna list out all the reasons why I'm writting this blog:
- I want to build a 'profile' for myself: I still don't know how to use social media, maybe because it's such a crowded place. Writing a blog is a safer place for me to build a presence without ... being too exposed.
- This is an extension of the first one: I want to connect to more people. But I understand no one would talk to someone 'out of no where' and with no credential.
- I want to record things I learn: I learn a surprising amount of knowledge in a week. Recording that would be valuable for future task.
- And finally: I want a place to show case my projects (dead and alive), organize the materials I collect online (a lot) and eventually turn this site into a platform for collaboration and data collection site (ambitous).

Promising that I will stick to this project won't do anything really. Just... my favorite blog is of [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/) and [Partrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/). I want to write like them.
